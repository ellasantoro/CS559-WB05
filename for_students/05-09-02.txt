Student explains where in the picture they connected Beziers for G(1) or C(1) continuity.

My shape has G(1) continuity in the cone shape of the ice cream. As you can see in the following code:
LINE 1: context?.moveTo(160, 200);
LINE 2: context?.bezierCurveTo(171,273,206,300,230,230);
LINE 3: context?.bezierCurveTo(254, 160, 245, 193, 220, 180);
LINE 4: context?.bezierCurveTo(195, 167, 133, 193, 160, 200);

the slope of the end of a curve is the same as the slope of the start of the next curve.
For example in line 2, we see that the difference in x (206 -> 230 is 24), so the start x value
of the next curve is 230 (end point of curve 1) + 24 , which is 254. repeat this process with y.
this concept applies to all of the curves in this cone shape.

Ensuring that the slopes are continuous ensures that it has G(1) continuity.

(please note that the other shapes/curves do not have this property, and the cone shape alone is my
G(1) continuous curve(s)).
