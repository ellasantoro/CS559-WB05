a0 = 10, 5
a1 = 20, 40
a2 = 5, 10
a3 = 15, 20

(for the x component, using these a's as coefficients for u = 1 (the end of the cubic), 
we will get it to equal to the desired end point (50): 10 + 20 + 5 + 15 = 50...
similarly with the y component where we want the desired end point to be 75:
5 + 40 + 10 + 20 = 75 -> recall this is because u = 1 at this point)
please replace the ? with numbers

NOTES:
starts (u = 0) @ 10,5
ends @ 50,75
